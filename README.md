The project has been created to show my technical skill to interested people.  
All tests written by RaphaÃ«l Darras.

## Technical Choices  

### End to End : Cypress  
I chose to use Cypress because this is the e2e framework I know the best.
I added a Cypress/Gherkin plugin to write scenarios with Gherkin syntax: I did it in the past but I knew the implementation had changed, so it was the occasion to show it to you and for me to update my knowledge of it.  

### API: Supertest
My knowledge of API testing and framework was pretty limited: I've used Postman in the past but not that much.
So I asked my friends in the tech world what would be a good framework to write API tests myself and Supertest came often in the answers.
It was fun to learn !
